# Themes

The default PrestaShop install offers the neutral "Classic theme", enabling sellers to quickly and freely start their activity, whatever their business line.

Several marketplaces are available to buy PrestaShop themes.

As a graphic designer/web developer, you too can put your themes up for sale on marketplaces.
