# Themes

The default PrestaShop installation offers the neutral "Classic theme", enabling merchants to quickly start their activity, whatever their business line.

Several marketplaces are available to get PrestaShop themes. The [PrestaShop Addons marketplace](https://addons.prestashop.com/) edited by Prestashop company offers many themes created either by members of the community or the PrestaShop company. Themes are technically validated to guarantee a good level of quality and security.

As a graphic designer/front developer, you can put your themes up for sale on marketplaces.
