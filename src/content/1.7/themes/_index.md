# Themes

The default PrestaShop install offers a neutral theme in black and white, enabling sellers to quickly and freely start their activity, whatever their business line.

More than 3000 themes are available at the [PrestaShop Addons marketplace](http://addons.prestashop.com/en/). They were created either by members of the PrestaShop community or the PrestaTeam, and are sold at reasonable prices â€“ some are even free.

As a graphic designer/web developer, you too can put your themes up for sale on the PrestaShop Addons marketplace, and earn 70% of the selling price.
