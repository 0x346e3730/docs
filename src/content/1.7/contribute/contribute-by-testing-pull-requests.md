# Why testing Pull Requests

Tests determine the quality of a software. This process involves evaluating information that is related to a shop.

To help on testing, we provide a [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) configuration designed for testing branches and pull requests.

## What is installed

- Debian 10 Buster
- Git
- Multiple PHP versions (7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4)
- MariaDB 10
- NodeJS

## Requires

First of all you need two tools to run this project:

- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

If you're using Windows, we recommend you to download [Git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and execute all commands under this shell.

## Why Vagrant

We use Vagrant because of its flexibility and portability.
With it, you can control every aspect of the machine, and help us by having a similar environment to reproduce issues.

## Getting started

Go to [https://github.com/PrestaShop/vagrant](https://github.com/PrestaShop/vagrant) and follow instructions.
