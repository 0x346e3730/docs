# How to edit a page on your computer using Git

Running a local copy of DevDocs on your computer is the best way to work on this project. Even though it requires a little extra work to set up, you will gain the ability to preview your changes almost instantly, as well as being able to introduce more than one change at a time.

## Prerequisites

To run a local DevDocs install on your system, you will need:

- Basic knowledge of your platform's command line.
- A GitHub account (That you can [create for free](https://github.com/join)).
- Git ([Setup guide](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)).
- Hugo site generator 0.55.0+ ([Install guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing)). 

## Installation

[Follow this guide][1] to install a local DevDocs.

## Submitting your changes

We recommend following the [GitHub workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), which involves creating a new branch for each "feature" you work on.  

This also involves **working on your own fork** ([learn how](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)) before submitting a Pull Request. 

To fork this project on GitHub, head to the [project's repository]({{% siteparam ghRepoURL %}}), then click on the "Fork" button on the top right corner of the screen.
