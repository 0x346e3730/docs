# How to contribute to the Core by submitting a Pull Request

If you're reading this, thank you! This means you're interested in contributing to PrestaShop.
You probably are a PrestaShop developer, and your use of the project is slightly different from
ours. For instance, there are few differences between PrestaShop 1.7 (the release) and the branch 1.7
of PrestaShop in the GitHub repository. This is because we create a release usable by everyone from our sources.

To be able to contribute you need:

* a **GitHub account**
* to know the **basics of git** and **how to use a github fork**
* to be able to run **prestashop** from the sources

PrestaShop is hosted on github.com and the way to submit code changes (pull requests) to the project is the standard *forks and pull requests flow*. This flow is explained in [the GitHub Forking Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

If you have trouble using this flow, great help can be found on [help.github.com](https://help.github.com/) or by looking at one of these detailed tutorials:

- https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/
- https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/

- https://dev.to/ceri_anne_dev/how-to-fork-and-contribute-to-a-github-repo-5bfp

This flow is a standard process for opensource projects to handle contributions but it can look quite complex. [This article](https://dev.to/mathieuks/introduction-to-github-fork-workflow-why-is-it-so-complex-3ac8) about the flow can help you understand the reasons for each part of the process.

We explain 2 ways to run PrestaShop from the sources:
