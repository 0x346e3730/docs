# Add new order

Page can be reached by going to `Sell -> Orders -> Orders -> Add new order`. It allows to create a new order for a
selected customer.

Order creation is still affected by customer addresses, taxes and other settings. So for example, if
selected Customer country or zone is disabled, you won't see any available carriers.
