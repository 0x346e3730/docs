# Order creation

Orders can be created either in Front Office (FO) by the customer or in Back Office (BO) by the shop admin.

## Filling the cart

To create the order you will have to fill the cart with the following information:

1. Personal information - details like name, email, birthday etc. In FO you can either fill this information manually as
   guest (and optionally create new customer account) or login with existing customer to use its information. In BO
   order creation you will be asked to select an existing customer before you can modify the existing cart or create a
   new one.
2. Address - provide the shipping and invoice addresses information. Shipping (a.k.a. delivery) address is where the
   ordered products should be sent while the invoice address is where the invoice is sent. In FO, you can provide one
   address to be used as both - shipping and invoice. In BO, you must select shipping and invoice addresses (the same
   address can also be selected for both - shipping and invoices). After this step is complete you will need to select
   available carriers (carriers are searched by delivery address and can be modified by shop admin in Improve ->
   Shipping -> Carriers page). Note - carrier will not be available if selected country or zone is disabled (in BO
   International -> Locations) or carrier shipping and locations settings are not configured.
