# Global components ?

It's a [new system](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/blob/develop/admin-dev/themes/new-theme/js/app/utils/init-components.js) mainly created for module developers, which allow you to use components we already use in the core without importing it.

You are now able to use components we expose to the `window.prestashop.component` object without importing anything.

This object contains two attributes :

- `component` which contain some components you can instanciate
- `instance` which contains every instances of initiated components

It allow module developers to avoid importing path such as `../../../../admin-dev/themes/new-module/js/components/translatable-field` because it was making hard to add a CI in order to build the module.

##Â How to use ?

There is an event sent after the execution of `initPrestashopComponents` which you can stick on : `PSComponentsInitiated`.

If you have the `events` package, you'll be able to catch the event like this :

```js
EventEmitter.on('PSComponentsInitiated', () => {
  [...]
})
```

You are able to custom a component like this :

```js
EventEmitter.on('PSComponentsInitiated', () => {
  window.prestashop.component.TranslatableField = MyCustomTranslatableField;

  if (window.prestashop.component.instance.translatableField) {
    window.prestashop.component.instance.translatableField = new window.prestashop.component.TranslatableField();
  }
});
```

or even import your own components that you want to make usable globally :

```js
EventEmitter.on('PSComponentsInitiated', () => {
  window.prestashop.component.MyCustomComponent = MyCustomComponent;
  window.prestashop.component.instance.myCustomComponent = new window.prestashop.component.MyCustomComponent();
});
```
