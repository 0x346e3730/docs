Testing
=======

Creating tests is an important part of a module life. In PrestaShop, we plan to cover our modules features with a bundle of unit and functional tests. We let you chose what frameworks suits you the best, but you have to know you're not alone. As we have the same needs, we provide some tools you can reuse to help you during your journey.

- Reduce time needed to test a module
- Improve overall quality of code
