# Notable changes in PrestaShop 1.7.7

## Order view page layout modifications

In this version the order page was migrated with Symfony. We used this migration as an opportunity to improve the page layout so that it meets the merchant needs.

### Modified hooks

These hooks **have been moved** and have new names, even though they are very similar to their former equivalent the layout has changed and thus the modules need to adapt their rendering:

| Former hook                | New hook                  | Modification           |
| -------------------------- |:------------------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **displayInvoice**         | **displayAdminOrderTop**  | It is now displayed at the very top of the order page (not in the main column any more)                |
| **displayAdminOrderRight** | **displayAdminOrderSide** | It is now displayed on the **left** which is why it was renamed based on its context not its position  |
| **displayAdminOrderLeft**  | **displayAdminOrderMain** | It is now displayed on the **right** which is why it was renamed based on its context not its position |

These hooks **had to be replaced** because they didn't use the same parameters as input value (only `id_order` is passed now), and the layout is drastically different. In order to integrate smoothly the new layout MUST respect the new page markups and styles.

| Former hook                                                            | New hook                        | Modification                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |:------------------------------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **displayAdminOrderTabOrder** and **displayAdminOrderTabShip**         | **displayAdminOrderTabLink**    | Both hooks are now combined in a single generic hook that allows you to include tab links the the order view page, it only has the *id_order* as a parameter    |
| **displayAdminOrderContentOrder** and **displayAdminOrderContentShip** | **displayAdminOrderTabContent** | Both hooks are now combined in a single generic hook that allows you to include tab contents the the order view page, it only has the *id_order* as a parameter |

These hooks have been added to the view page:

| Former hook                       | Function                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **displayBackOfficeOrderActions** | It is displayed in the side column (similar to displayAdminOrderSide) but right under the customer view                             |
| **actionGetAdminOrderButtons**    | It is used to build a collection of buttons in the order thanks to an `ActionsBarButtonsCollection` which si automatically rendered |
