# Backward compatibility with PrestaShop 1.6

If you plan to develop a module for PrestaShop 1.7 then extending the compatibility with previous major versions of PrestaShop,
it may require some changes before being ready for production.

## Namespaces

PrestaShop 1.6 does not fully support namespaces. They throw some issues when used in specific places.

* In the main class of your module, the keyword `use [...];` will trigger syntax errors when PrestaShop will try to parse the file.
* ObjectModels can't be defined in a namespace. The hook generated while managing this entity will be considered as invalid by the `Validate` class and will trigger fatal errors.

## PHP API updates

The visibility of many functions have been switched to `public` between two versions of PrestaShop (i.e `Link::getBaseLink()` which was `protected` then `public` from PS 1.6.1.15). 
We recommend using a static analysis tool like [PhpStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) to detect these changes.

## Templating

`addCSS` / `addJS` / `jsDef` may not work properly on PrestaShop 1.6.0.* when sending Json data to a template.
We recommend sending your variables without trying to encode them. PrestaShop will handle them and avoid escaping issues with quotes.


```patch
$translations = [
    'dummy1' => 'Example of data',
    'dummy2' => 'Another example of data',
];

Media::addJsDef([
-    'translations' => json_encode($translations),
+    'translations' => $translations, // Data will be encoded by PrestaShop
]);
```
