# Notable changes in PrestaShop 1.7.6

## CLDR

The CLDR is a component responsible of displaying data such as the date & time, prices depending on a given language. It was reworked during several versions of PrestaShop 1.7, and will be enabled with 1.7.6. The previous one has been removed, and trying to use it will end to an exception.

A new variable is now available in the `Context` when going through a controller:

```php
class ContextCore
{
    /**
     * Current locale instance.
     *
     * @var PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Core\Localization\Locale
     */
    public $currentLocale;

    [...]
}
```

This property is the link to format properly a number:

```php
Context::getContext()->currentLocale->formatNumber(123.45);
```

or a price:

```php
Context::getContext()->currentLocale->formatPrice(123.45, 'EUR');
```

Remember that you can retrieve the contextual currency code as follows:

```php
Context::getContext()->currency->iso_code; // returns 'EUR' for Euro, 'USD' for US dollars, ...
```

Also, note that `Tools::displayNumber(...)` and`Tools::displayPrice(...)` work as before, although deprecated.
