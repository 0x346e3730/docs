Notable changes in PrestaShop 1.7.5
=======

## LazyArrays

Starting with PrestaShop 1.7.5, the business objects (Product, Order...) available on the front-office are `LazyArray` instances. If your module relies on data available in the hook parameters or in the template, you may be concerned by this update.

They used to be `arrays` with all the data available. This change has been introduced to load the needed properties of an object only when requested, and globally improve the performance of the front-office.

Getting properties from the object should not change between first versions of PS 1.7 and 1.7.5.

However it appeared that some modules, especially the ones with a high compatibility range like PrestaShop 1.6 & 1.7, apply an array cast when the variable in not an array. **Casting these variables as arrays on PS 1.7.5+ will throw notices when getting their properties.**


|    | 1.6 | 1.7.0+ | 1.7.5+ |
|----|-----|--------|--------|
| Variable type / class | `ObjectModel` | `array` | `PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Adapter\Presenter\AbstractLazyArray` |
| Getting a property | `{(array)$var}['id']` or `$var->id` | `$var['id']` | `$var['id']` or `$var->id` |

Applying an `(array)` cast is valid only when you have a `ObjectModel` instance, for instance `Product`. Otherwise, you already have an array-compliant variable.

```php
public function hookdisplayFooterProduct($params)
{
    /*
    * Depending on the PrestaShop you run, the $product type won't be the same.
    * On PrestaShop 1.7, it can be directly used as an array.
    * 
    * However, if the module is also compatible with PrestaShop 1.6, 1.5...
    * an ObjectModel class will be returned.
    * Casting it as an array *in this specific situation* will allow to cover all cases.
    */
    $product = $params['product'];
    if ($product instanceof Product /* or ObjectModel */) {
        $product = (array) $product;
    }

    // Getting product details.
    echo $product['id'];
}
```
