# Notable changes in PrestaShop 1.7.7

## Order view page layout modifications

In this version the order page has been migrated with Symfony. We used this migration as an opportunity to improve the page layout to meet the merchants' needs.
You can see a representation of these new hooks in the page here:

### Modified hooks

The following hooks **have been moved** and have new names. Even though they are very similar to their former equivalents the layout has changed and thus the modules need to adapt their rendering.

Removed hook                                                           | New hook                        | Modification
---------------------------------------------------------------------- |:------------------------------- |:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**displayAdminOrderRight**                                             | **displayAdminOrderSideBottom** | It is now displayed on the **left** which is why it was renamed based on its context not its position, since the layout is completely different it has no alias
**displayAdminOrderLeft**                                              | **displayAdminOrderMainBottom** | It is now displayed on the **right** which is why it was renamed based on its context not its position, since the layout is completely different it has no alias
**displayAdminOrderTabOrder** and **displayAdminOrderTabShip**         | **displayAdminOrderTabLink**    | Both hooks are now combined in a single generic hook that allows you to include tab links the the order view page, it only has the *id_order* as a parameter
**displayAdminOrderContentOrder** and **displayAdminOrderContentShip** | **displayAdminOrderTabContent** | Both hooks are now combined in a single generic hook that allows you to include tab contents the the order view page, it only has the *id_order* as a parameter

These hooks have been aliased, although we recommend migrating to the new hooks and check that it integrates correctly with the new layout:

Deprecated hook                   | New aliased hook          | Modification
--------------------------------- |:------------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**displayBackOfficeOrderActions** | **displayAdminOrderSide** | Although it has been aliased for convenience, the new hook is not displayed at the same place at all (it is now in the side column), so we suggest to verify how your code integrates into the new layout. If you need to add action buttons, use the new **actionGetAdminOrderButtons** hook
**displayInvoice**                | **displayAdminOrderTop**  | This hook has the same placement and parameters

These hooks have been added to the view page:

New hook                       | Function
------------------------------ |:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**displayAdminOrderSide**      | It is displayed in the side column (similar to displayAdminOrderSideBottom) but right under the customer view
**displayAdminOrderMain**      | It is displayed in the side column (similar to displayAdminOrderMainBottom) but right under the details view
**actionGetAdminOrderButtons** | It is used to build a collection of buttons in the order thanks to an `ActionsBarButtonsCollection` which is automatically rendered
